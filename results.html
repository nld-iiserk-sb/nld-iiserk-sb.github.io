  <h2>Vulnerable Lines of the Indian Power Grid</h2>

  <p><strong>Arnab Acharya and Soumitro Banerjee</strong></p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> A number of large blackouts in recent years have necessitated the advent of newer methods for assessing power grid vulnerability. In this study, we have constructed the Indian power grid network from raw data. The network structure is probed using Complex Network metrics. The structural vulnerability of the Indian grid to random failures is investigated. A DC power flow based cascade simulation is used to identify the vulnerable power lines of the Indian power grid.</p>
