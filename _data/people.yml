  description: A BS-MS student in the Department of Physical Sciences working under the supervision of Prof. Banerjee. I Studied the nonlinearities in Quantum systems ( Open Quantum Systems ) and the quantum to classical transition for classically nonlinear systems. Then, I worked on a cross-platform desktop app and a python package which contained implementations of algorithms usefull for studying piecewise-smooth continuous systems.

  description: I primarily work in the post-Newtonian formalism using the General Relativistic model of gravitational system. Tell-tale signs of non-linearity, in the form of quasi-periodic or multi-periodic orbits around black hole systems are the focus of my work. Geodesic equations are taken as the basis and hence, this involves heavy computational work. I intend to extend my work into numerical relativity in the coming days, analyzing compact binary systems.<br><br>After completing my preliminary school education, I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Technology, specializing in Electronics and Communications. I have an ardent interest in diverse areas like Internet of Things, Machine Learning and Neural Networks, as well as Artificial Intelligence of game playing bots. Other than this, I am a puzzles and games aficionado and a competitive quizzer.

  description: I received my B.Sc degree in Physics from Visa-Bharati University in 2012. I am a 6th year Integrated PhD student in IISER-Kolkata.<br><br>I am mainly interested in three dimensional piecewise smooth systems. Systems that are not smooth can undergo bifurcations that are forbidden in smooth systems, such as border collision bifurcations and robust chaos. I have also studied synchronization in periodic oscillators.

  description: I completed my B.S.-M.S. dual degree (physics majors) from IISER Kolkata in 2015. In my masters' thesis completed under Prof. Banerjee, I worked on the generalization of dangerous bifurcations occurring in piecewise smooth maps. My work primarily comprised of finding additional mechanisms by which --- and uncovering additional regions in the parameter space where --- such bifurcations might occur.<br><br>Currently, I am working as a Ph.D. student in the University of Oldenburg, Germany on the generation and propagation of extreme events which are rare, aperiodic, recurrent events which have a large impact on dynamical systems. Currently, I am studying model excitable systems like FitzHugh-Nagumo Oscillators (which are known to generate extreme events) and trying to find signatures left by such events prior to their occurrence and develop precursors to these events
